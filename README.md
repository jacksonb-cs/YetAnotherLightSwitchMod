# Lethal Company: Yet Another Light Switch Mod
A Lethal Company mod that always pays the ships electricity bill (the light can never be turned off).

## Description
Lightning? Remote control? Pesky crew mates? The lights will never be shut off. Ever.

This mod was created because I experienced some issues with other similar mods.

## Compatibility
This is a client-side mod. Anyone with the mod will always see the ship's lights as being on. Anyone without the mod will be unaffected.

## Website
Feel free to check out the (very simple) [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/jacksonb-cs/YetAnotherLightSwitchMod)! Please create a GitHub issue if any problems arise.
